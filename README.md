# PyBer_Analysis

#### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to summarize the given ride-sharing data by city type, either urban, suburban, or rural. Then, I was to create a graph that shows the weekly ride-share fares by city type over a period of time.

#### Results
The data frame shows that urban ride-shares account for more fares than suburban and rual fares combined by a significant margin, though not quite double. It also shows that urban ride-shares were the only ones where the average fare per driver was less than the average fare per ride.

Here is the graph of total weekly fares by city type:

#### Summary
The discrepancy between urban fares and those of other city types indicates that providing ride-share services in rural and suburban areas should either charge higher fares, or that the service may not yet be suited for those types of cities. In any case, it is usually far more beneficial to concentrate on urban locations. The graph confirms this recommendation. From the data and the graph, it appears that the weeks near the beginning of March are some of the highest-earning in the quarter. Another recommendation could be to offer coupon discounts, buy-one get-one promotions, or other offers for urban customers to increase ridership outside of this peak time period, as ride-shares are noticeably lower at the beginning of January. Another trend to notice is that, at the end of April, fares from suburban customers were increasing, while those from urban customers were noticeably decreasing. However, without including more data for the remaining months in the year, accurate analysis and recommendations cannot be made. I recommend providing me more data for the Summer months and giving me additional time and support to draw a meaningful conclusion.
